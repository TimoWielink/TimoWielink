I have been working on Open Source projects for years, at [OWL](https://www.project-owl.com) we open sourced [The ClusterDuck Protocol](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ClusterDuck-Protocol) together with the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) after winning the [IBM Call For Code](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
