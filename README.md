### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Timo!

I have been working on Open Source projects for years, at [project-owl](https://www.project-owl.com) we open sourced [The ClusterDuck Protocol](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ClusterDuck-Protocol) together with the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) after winning the [IBM Call For Code](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). I work as a product designer and Front-End developer and like to work on hardware projects in my spare time.
